Changes (i.e. Git commit messages) since the last release ($last_tag) have been
written into $release_notes.

Hit Return for that file to be popped up.  (Assuming that \$EDITOR is usefully
set on your machine.  If not, hit Return and then open the file yourself.)
Then review and edit that (as necessary) so as to provide a good set of release
notes for our partners and customers, saying what is new or changed in this
release.

EOF

$EDITOR $release_notes

cat <<EOF

Edited release notes are:

EOF
cat $release_notes

cat <<EOF

Hit Return to confirm that these are good to release.  (Otherwise edit the file
some more until they are good, and then hit Return.)

# Create annotated release tag.
git tag $nextrel -F $release_notes
