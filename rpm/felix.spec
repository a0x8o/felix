%description
Project Calico is an open source solution for virtual networking in
cloud data centers. Its IP-centric architecture offers numerous
advantages over other cloud networking approaches such as VLANs and
overlays, including scalability, efficiency, and simplicity. It is
designed for a wide range of environments including OpenStack,
lightweight Linux containers (LXCs), bare metal, and Network Functions
Virtualization (NFV).

%changelog
* Wed Mar 29 2017 Neil Jerram <neil@tigera.io> 2.1.1-1
  - Felix 2.1.1 (from Git commit ff29d69).
    [Changes recorded in 2.1.1 tag]
    - Seed Go's RNG.
    - Fix felix.go imports.
    - Rev libcalico-go to 1.1.4, to pick up pod deletion fix (libcalico-go
      #375) when using the Kubernetes datastore driver.
    - Ensure IP forwarding is enabled on the interfaces we control.

* Fri Mar 17 2017 Neil Jerram <neil@tigera.io> 2.1.0-1
  - Felix 2.1.0 (from Git commit fb5b330).
    [Changes recorded in 2.1.0 tag]
    - Port dataplane driver to Golang and move in-process (#1202).
      This has a number of benefits and allowed for a number of
      bugfixes and enhancements to be worked in:
    
      - Improve dataplane programming performance and decrease
        occupancy by having only one process instead of two.
        It also simplifies the codebase substantially.
      - Simplify deployment (now only one binary needed).
      - Use netlink directly for critical-path route programming
        operations.
      - Move to a synchronization model for route programming.
        Allows for monitoring and restoring routes if they are
        removed.  Allows for clean up of routes that relate to
        orphaned endpoints.
      - Ensure IPIP tunnel device configuration is maintained;
        replace it if it is accidentally removed.
      - Retry iptables/ipset updates in more failure cases to work
        around transient failures of those commands.
      - Switch to a synchronisation model for iptables.  Avoid
        reprogramming rules that haven't changed.  This improves
        performance.
      - Label our iptables rules with a hash to allow rules to be
        identified.  Allows for simpler sync and cleanup.
      - Limit OpenStack special-case rules to deployments with "tap"
        devices (#1020).
    
    - Add support for host endpoint policies that bypass the conntrack
      table.  Useful for high connection throughput workloads such as
      memcacheDB. (#1284)
    - Fix that setting LogFilePath doesn't prevent early logging (#803)
    - Fix log spam when adding tunl0 device (#1008)
    - Retry ipset commands to deal with transient failures (#1181)
    - Document deb/RPM release process (#1237)
    - Rev libcalico-go to v1.1.3, includes a number of fixes (#1364).

    - Build the felix RPMS on EL6 as well (#1327)
    - Disable interfaces that are admin down. (#1354)
    - Throttle dataplane updates and opportunistically batch. (#1356)
    - Fix IP address parsing to use net.IP.To4() instead of len(). (#1358)
    - Rev calico/go-build container to v0.4 to pick up patch to runtime.
    - Implement bulk updates to ipsets. (Improves performance.)
    - Implement periodic resyncs of IP sets. (Works around #1347)
    - Add prometheus metrics for exec calls.
    - Rev libcalico-go to 1.1.1. (Includes minor fixes.)
    [Changes recorded in 2.1.0-rc5 tag]
    - Change chain name prefix from "cali" to "cali-" to avoid conflict with DHCP agent. (#1336)
    - Remove unused policy rendering code and simplify. (#1337)
    - Decouple stats collector from usage reporter (#1353).
    - Add log to indicate end of initial sync. (#1350)
    - Ignore removal of non-Calico chain. Fixes spammy warning logs. (#1352)

* Mon Oct 19 2015 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.2.0-0.2.pre
  - Add liveness reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports its liveness into
    etcd and the neutron driver copies that information to the Neutron DB.
    If Felix is down on a host, Neutron will not try to schedule a VM on
    that host.
  - Add endpoint status reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports the state of
    endpoints into etcd so that the OpenStack plugin can report this
    information into Neutron.  If Felix fails to configure a port, this now
    causes VM creation to fail.
  - Performance enhancements to ipset manipulation.
  - Rev python-etcd dependency to 0.4.1.  Our patched python-etcd version
    (which contains additional patches) is still required.
  - Reduce occupancy of Felix's tag resolution index in the common case
    where IP addresses only have a single owner.
