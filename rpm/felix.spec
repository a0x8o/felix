%description
Project Calico is an open source solution for virtual networking in
cloud data centers. Its IP-centric architecture offers numerous
advantages over other cloud networking approaches such as VLANs and
overlays, including scalability, efficiency, and simplicity. It is
designed for a wide range of environments including OpenStack,
lightweight Linux containers (LXCs), bare metal, and Network Functions
Virtualization (NFV).

      change that extends Calico's security model to hosts as well as the
      workloads running on them.
    - InterfacePrefix now defaults to "cali", which is a safe default that happens
      to be the correct value for container systems.
    - MAC address field in endpoint objects is now optional.  If omitted, the MAC
      address is not policed in iptables.

* Thu Feb 25 2016 Shaun Crampton <shaun@projectcalico.org> 1.3.0-1
  - Felix now parses the etcd snapshot in parallel with the event stream;
    this dramatically increases scale when under load.
  - Various performance and scale improvements.
  - Removed support for Python 2.6.  python-etcd no longer supports 2.6
    as of 0.4.3.

    the IPIP tunnel device to be set.
  - Add IptablesMarkMask configuration parameter to control which bits are
    used from the iptables forwarding mark.
  - Increase default size of ipsets and make configurable via the
    MaxIpsetSize parameter.
  - Bug fixes, including fixes to NAT when using IPIP mode.

* Tue Jan 12 2016 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.3.0-0.6.pre
  - Pre-release of 1.3.0.

* Thu Dec 10 2015 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.2.2-1
  - Don't report port deletion as an error status.
  - Improve leader election performance after restart.
  - Catch additional python-etcd exceptions.
  - Reduce election refresh interval.
  - Resolve "Felix dies if interface missing" on Alpine Linux.
  - Rebase to latest 2015.1.2 and 2014.2.4 upstream Ubuntu packages.

* Fri Nov 13 2015 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.2.1-1
  - Fix Felix ipset exception when using IPIP.
  - Use iptables protocol numbers not names.
  - Fixes to diagnostics collection scripts.
  - Pin networking-calico pip version.

* Mon Oct 26 2015 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.2.0-1
  - Truncate long output from FailedSystemCall exception.
  - Add instructions for use with OpenStack Liberty.

* Mon Oct 19 2015 Matt Dupre <matt@projectcalico.org> 1.2.0-0.2.pre
  - Add liveness reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports its liveness into
    etcd and the neutron driver copies that information to the Neutron DB.
    If Felix is down on a host, Neutron will not try to schedule a VM on
    that host.
  - Add endpoint status reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports the state of
    endpoints into etcd so that the OpenStack plugin can report this
    information into Neutron.  If Felix fails to configure a port, this now
    causes VM creation to fail.
  - Performance enhancements to ipset manipulation.
  - Rev python-etcd dependency to 0.4.1.  Our patched python-etcd version
    (which contains additional patches) is still required.
  - Reduce occupancy of Felix's tag resolution index in the common case
    where IP addresses only have a single owner.
  - Felix now sets the default.rp_filter sysctl to ensure that endpoints
    come up with the Kernel's RPF check enabled by default.
  - Optimize Felix's actor framework to reduce message-passing overhead.

* Tue Sep 08 2015 Neil Jerram <Neil.Jerram@metaswitch.com> 1.1.0
  - Improve the documentation about upgrading a Calico/OpenStack system.
  - Fix compatibility with latest OpenStack code (oslo_config).
  - Use posix_spawn to improve Felix's performance under heavy load.
  - Explicitly use and enable the kernel's reverse path filtering
    function, and remove our iptables anti-spoofing rules, which were not
    as robust.

    type 'local' or 'flat' with Calico.

    necessary state has been configured, to avoid race conditions.
  - Prevent systemd restarting Felix when it is killed by administrators.

* Mon Jun 22 2015 Cory Benfield <cory@projectcalico.org> 0.25
  - Remove stale conntrack entries when an endpoint's IP is removed.
  - #672: Fix bug where profile chain was left empty instead of being
    stubbed out.
  - Improve security between endpoint and host and simplify INPUT chain logic.

* Mon Jun 15 2015 Cory Benfield <cory@projectcalico.org> 0.24

    OpenStack and Docker systems.

    interfaces.
  - Prevent the possibility of gevent context-switching during garbage collection
    in Felix.
  - Increase the number of file descriptors available to Felix.
