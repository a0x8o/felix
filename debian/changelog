felix (2.1.0~__STREAM__) __STREAM__; urgency=low

  * Felix 2.1.0 (from Git commit fb5b330).
    [Changes recorded in 2.1.0 tag]
    - Port dataplane driver to Golang and move in-process (#1202).
      This has a number of benefits and allowed for a number of
      bugfixes and enhancements to be worked in:
    
      - Improve dataplane programming performance and decrease
        occupancy by having only one process instead of two.
        It also simplifies the codebase substantially.
      - Simplify deployment (now only one binary needed).
      - Use netlink directly for critical-path route programming
        operations.
      - Move to a synchronization model for route programming.
        Allows for monitoring and restoring routes if they are
        removed.  Allows for clean up of routes that relate to
        orphaned endpoints.
      - Ensure IPIP tunnel device configuration is maintained;
        replace it if it is accidentally removed.
      - Retry iptables/ipset updates in more failure cases to work
        around transient failures of those commands.
      - Switch to a synchronisation model for iptables.  Avoid
        reprogramming rules that haven't changed.  This improves
        performance.
      - Label our iptables rules with a hash to allow rules to be
        identified.  Allows for simpler sync and cleanup.
      - Limit OpenStack special-case rules to deployments with "tap"
        devices (#1020).
    
    - Add support for host endpoint policies that bypass the conntrack
      table.  Useful for high connection throughput workloads such as
      memcacheDB. (#1284)
