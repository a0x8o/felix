## How can I get support for contributing to Project Calico?

The best place to ask a question or get help from the community is the
[calico-users #slack](https://slack.projectcalico.org).  We also have
[an IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#calico).

## Who is behind Project Calico?

[Tigera, Inc.](https://www.tigera.io/) is the company behind Project Calico
and is responsible for the ongoing management of the project. However, it
is open to any members of the community – individuals or organizations –
to get involved and contribute code.

## Contributing

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Project Calico! The success of an
open source project is entirely down to the efforts of its contributors, so we
do genuinely want to thank you for even thinking of contributing.

Before you do so, you should check out our contributing guidelines in the
`CONTRIBUTING.md` file, to make sure it's as easy as possible for us to accept
your contribution.

## How do I build Felix?

Felix mostly uses Docker for builds.  We develop on Ubuntu 16.04 but other
Linux distributions should work (there are known Makefile that prevent building on OS X).  
To build Felix, you will need:

- A suitable linux box.
- To check out the code into your GOPATH.
- Docker >=1.12
- GNU make.
- Plenty of disk space (since the builds use some heavyweight
  full-OS containers in order to build debs and RPMs).

Then, as a one-off, run
```
make update-tools
```
which will install a couple more go tools that we haven't yet containerised.
 
Then, to build the calico-felix binary:
```
make bin/calico-felix
```
or, the `calico/felix` docker image:
```
make calico/felix
```

## How can I run Felix's unit tests?

To run all the UTs:
```
make ut
```

To start a `ginkgo watch`, which will re-run the relevant UTs as you update files:
```
make ut-watch
```

To get coverage stats:
```
make cover-report
```
or 
```
make cover-browser
```

## How can a subset of the go unit tests?

If you want to be able to run unit tests for specific packages for more iterative
development, you'll need to install

- GNU make
- go >=1.7

then run `make update-tools` to install ginkgo, which is the test tool used to
run Felix's unit tests.

There are several ways to run ginkgo.  One option is to change directory to the
package you want to test, then run `ginkgo`.  Another is to use ginkgo's
watch feature to monitor files for changes:
```
cd go
ginkgo watch -r
```
Ginkgo will re-run tests as files are modified and saved.

## How do I build packages/run Felix?

### Docker

After building the docker image (see above), you can run Felix and log to screen 
with, for example:
`docker run --privileged --net=host -e FELIX_LOGSEVERITYSCREEN=INFO calico/felix`

### Debs and RPMs

The `Makefile` has targets for building debs and RPMs for different platforms.
By using docker, the build does not need to be run on the target platform.
```
make deb
make rpm
```
The packages (and source packages) are output to the dist directory.
