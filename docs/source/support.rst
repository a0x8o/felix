Support
=======

There are three support mechanisms for Calico:

-  Mailing list. This is for questions about Calico, or for asking for
   help.
-  Issues. These are for problems with Calico. If you're not sure
   whether a certain behaviour is expected or not, you should ask on the
   mailing list first.
-  Pull Requests. These allow you to contribute fixes and enhancements
   back to Calico.

Information about the mailing list and pull requests can be found on our
:doc:`involved` page, as they are also how to get proactively involved in
Calico development.

Issues
------

Calico uses GitHub's Issues system to track problems. To access the
Issues system, first determine which project the issue is with - ask in
the mailing list if you're not sure. Then go to that project's
repository page in GitHub and click the Issues tab at the top.

Remember to do a search for existing issues covering your problem before
raising a new one!
