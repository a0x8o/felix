## Global the test machine; use the system-wide Python becaues tox will create
## its own virtualenvs.
machine:
  post:
    - pyenv global
  services:
    - docker

## Install Calico build/test deps.
dependencies:
  pre:
    - sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libyajl2 python-dev make
    - sudo pip install tox coverage

## Run our test script, which ultimately runs tox.  We need to call
## "deactivate" to get out of the virtualenv that CircleCI creates by default.
test:
  override:
    - make ut
  post:
    - cp -r python/.coverage python/coverage.xml python/htmlcov $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS
